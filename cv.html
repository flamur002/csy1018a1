            <p>Hello, I'm Flamur Karaj!</p>
            <p>I am an undergraduate student, studying for Computing (Software Engineering). I have a lot of passion for technology related subjects, especially for coding and programming. I have learned and can comfortably use programming and markup languages, such as HTML, CSS, Java etc. I am able to design & create fully functional websites and develop small softwares for computers (e.g. small games, softwares that can calculate various things etc.) by creating Graphical User Interfaces and algorithms. I think that my patience and my perseverance are my key strengths that make me stand out and always accomplish my intentions. </p>
