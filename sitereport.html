            <p>Learning Web Development was a long but adventurous journey. On the first term we went throughout HTML and CSS coding.  We started from the very basics to the most detailed functions and options of HTML and CSS languages. The reason that I really like this module, is because besides from learning, it gives you the ability create. By using your fantasy, you can design depending on your choices. You can arrange thing however you want in the web page, add images, text, choose fonts, colours and generally speaking you can design a web site in every single way you could think of. Additionally, HTML and CSS languages are pretty easy to learn and understand. Their structure is simple, rather than being complex and difficult to memorize and acknowledge. I am very excited to learn more about Web Development and widen my intelligence and knowledge. Hopefully, in the future I have the expertness to work as a Full Stack Web Developer and create my own fully functional websites. </p>
            <p>In the website that I created for the Assignment 1, I put my maximum effort and I tried to use all of my skills and abilities in order to create a good looking and responsive website. The main colour I used blue, as it is my favourite colour. I also used some lighter shades of that colour in order to have better looking and less boring website. Most of the code I used was either mine or code taken from the module lessons. However, I also used lines or pieces of lines for both HTML and CSS, which I took from the web. Those helped me create the design and appearance which I was thinking about and wanted to implement. Also, I used those codes in order to have a fully validated code for all of the pages. All of the code not written by me is shown below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>On every image tag on my page, I used the ‘alt’ attribute. For example in the ‘portfolio.html’ code, for all of the six images used on that page, I used an (alt=””) attribute inside the opening tag of the images. The reason I used those empty alt attributes was because none of the images had an attribute, which resulted in a failed validation test. That line of code was taken from the webpage https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#text_alternatives under the ‘Empty alt attributes’ section.</li>
                <li>All of the link in my websites are not underlined. That’s a result of the codes used in the ‘styles.css’ file in the lines 78-81 and in the ‘mobile.css’ file in the lines 68-71. The code that I did not write is the ‘text-decoration: none;’ which was taken from the webpage https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp under the ‘Text Decoration’ section.
                    </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also, 6 out of 7 of my .html and .css files pass validation as shown below:</p>
